In this folder, we have three text files, each containing categorized information about repositories:

1- False_positives:
      This file lists repositories that initially appeared to be checkers but, upon closer inspection, were identified as mere proof-of-concepts (PoCs). Each entry          includes an explanation justifying its classification as a false positive.
      
2- JustREADME-Empty-Excluded:
      This file contains repositories that were excluded from analysis due to being empty, containing only a README file, or having no relevant content.
      
3- Positives:
      This file includes repositories that were manually reviewed and confirmed to be actual checkers. Each entry is accompanied by a detailed explanation supporting        its classification.
