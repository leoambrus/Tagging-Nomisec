Classification of Software Vulnerability Artifacts
This repository contains the PDF version of the research article titled "Classification of Software Vulnerability Artifacts."

📄 Article Summary
The paper presents a methodology for classifying, filtering, and annotating software vulnerability artifacts, such as patches, exploits, proof-of-concept (PoC) codes, and checkers. By analyzing artifacts collected from GitHub through the NomiSec platform, the study highlights the importance of artifact classification in understanding the exploitation potential of vulnerabilities.

Key contributions include:

Evaluation of the coverage and relevance of sources like NomiSec.

Identification of non-threatening artifacts and their role in exploit understanding.

Visualization and clustering of vulnerability-related artifacts.

Research hypotheses exploring the relationship between artifact types, network exposure, and user reputation.

📌 Main Hypotheses
Most checkers are associated with network-access vulnerabilities, prioritizing broader attack surfaces.

A GitHub user's reputation influences the chances of their artifact being referenced by curated databases like NVD or InTheWild.

✅ Takeaway Message
Classifying vulnerability-related artifacts enables the identification of high-risk threats and supports more effective risk assessment through the combination of multiple data sources.
